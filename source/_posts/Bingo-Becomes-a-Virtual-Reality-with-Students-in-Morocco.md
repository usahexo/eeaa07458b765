#  Bingo Becomes a Virtual Reality with Students in Morocco

The game of bingo is often played in physical casinos, with players marking off numbers on cards as they are called out. But what if you could play bingo from the comfort of your own home, without having to leave your living room?

Thanks to virtual reality, this is now a possibility. A company called VR360 has developed a bingo game that can be played in VR using a headset such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive.

The game is set in a virtual casino, where players can chat with each other and mark off their numbers on virtual bingo cards. There are also a number of different rooms to choose from, each with its own unique theme.

VR360 is currently running a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the development of their bingo game. Backers can get their hands on an early version of the game by pledging £10 or more.

So why should you care about VR bingo? Well, for one thing, it’s a great way to socialize with other people. The VR casino setting provides a fun and engaging community environment that’s perfect for chatting and making new friends.

For another thing, it’s a great way to kill some time. If you’re looking for a fun and entertaining activity that doesn’t require too much effort, then VR bingo is definitely worth checking out.

#  Bingo is Introduced to New Technology with Students in Morocco

Recently, Bingo has been getting a lot of attention for being one of the most popular games in Casinos, right next to Roulette and Poker. However, not many people know that this game actually originated from Italy, where it was played with tarot cards instead of paper sheets. In the early 1870s, when the game was brought over to America, it became known as “Beano” due to players shouting “beano” when they won a round. It wasn’t until 1929 when the game was renamed to “Bingo” due to a misprint on the calling card.

Despite its age, Bingo is still being enjoyed by many people all over the world and it has even made its way into new technology with students in Morocco. Located in North Africa, Morocco is home to more than 34 million people and is known for its diverse culture. Recently, a group of students from the University of Rabat created an online version of Bingo that can be played on any device, including cell phones and computers. The game is called “Mobbingo” and it has quickly become popular among students due to its simplicity and ease of use.

To play Mobbingo, users simply need to register for an account on the website and choose a room to join. Once in the room, they will be given a card with 24 randomly generated numbers. Players then have to mark off numbers as they are called by clicking on them. If they get five numbers in a row – either vertically, horizontally or diagonally – they win the round and earn points that can be used to purchase prizes.

Since its launch in 2016, Mobbingo has gained more than 10,000 registered users and continues to grow at a fast pace. The developers are currently working on adding new features to the game, such as leaderboards and tournaments. They also plan to translate Mobbingo into other languages so that more people can enjoy it worldwide.

#  Enjoying Bingo with Moroccan Students

I was recently in Morocco teaching a seminar on using technology in the classroom and one of the activities we did was play bingo with the students. They loved it! The objective was for them to review vocabulary words, but they also had a lot of fun playing it.

I thought it would be fun to share the game here on my blog. I’ve created a printable PDF version that you can use with your students.

To play, first print out the game board and vocabulary cards. Cut out the cards and place them in a container or bag. Students will take turns picking a card and then looking for the word on the game board. If they find it, they mark off that square. The first player to get five squares in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) wins the game.

I hope your students enjoy playing this game as much as my Moroccan students did!

#  Technology Provides New Way to Play Bingo with Moroccan Students

A few weeks ago, while in Morocco, I had the opportunity to play bingo with some local students. It was a lot of fun!

I was impressed by how well the students knew the game and how quickly they were able to call out the numbers. After playing a few rounds, I asked one of the students how they learned to play bingo.

It turns out that the students learned to play bingo through technology. A few months ago, a group of volunteers created a website where you can play bingo with other people from around the world. The site has since been translated into multiple languages, including Arabic.

The site is called “Bingo World” and it’s a great way for students (and anyone else) to learn new words and phrases in other languages. You can also practice your math skills by counting out the numbers during each round.
