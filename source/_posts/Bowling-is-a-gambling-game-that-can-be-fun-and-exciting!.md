#  Bowling is a gambling game that can be fun and exciting!

Unlike golf and other such so-called "sports," bowling is a game that can be enjoyed by all, regardless of your age or physical fitness level. It's a great way to get some exercise, without having to worry about hitting a tiny ball hundreds of yards down a fairway.

Bowling is also a relatively affordable hobby. You can find a bowling alley in just about any town in the country, and most offer discounted rates for league play. You can also buy your own bowling ball and shoes relatively cheaply, if you're so inclined.

Finally, bowling is just plain fun! Whether you're playing with friends or family members, or competing against others in a league, there's always something exciting happening on the lanes. So why not give it a try?
