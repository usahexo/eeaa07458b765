#  Nevada, Delaware Offer Mobile Sports Betting; More States to Follow?

As the US Supreme Court deliberates a case that could legalize sports betting nationwide, individual states are taking matters into their own hands.

 Nevada and Delaware have both legalized mobile sports betting, and more states are expected to follow suit.

Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting in 1949, but the practice has been limited to casinos until now.

Delaware was the second state to legalize mobile sports betting, but it has been available in casinos there since 2009.

The move comes as the US Supreme Court is expected to rule on a case that could legalize sports betting nationwide. The high court heard oral arguments in the case on December 4th and is expected to issue a ruling by the end of June.

At issue is the 1992 federal law called the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which effectively bans sports betting outside of Nevada. The law was challenged by New Jersey, which argued that PASPA infringed on states’ rights.

A number of states have expressed interest in legalizing sports betting if the Supreme Court strikes down PASPA. These include New York, California, Illinois, Michigan, and Connecticut.

Legalizing mobile sports betting makes sense for states looking to boost revenue from gambling. In Nevada, for example, mobile sports betting generated $7 million in revenue in its first two weeks of operation. That’s a tiny fraction of Nevada’s overall gaming revenue, but it’s still a significant amount of money.

#  Pennsylvania, New Jersey Offering Mobile Sports Betting

Pennsylvania and New Jersey are now among the states that offer mobile sports betting. The news was confirmed by ESPN's David Purdum on Thursday, July 11.

Both states were given the green light to offer online sports betting in June by the United States Supreme Court. The high court overturned a 26-year-old federal ban on sports gambling.

"It will be available on your phone, on your computer," said Purdum. "So you can bet from anywhere within the state."

New Jersey is expected to launch its mobile sports betting app on Thursday, July 11. Pennsylvania is expected to follow suit in the coming days.

Players in both states will be able to place bets through their smartphones or computers on a variety of sporting events, including professional and collegiate games.

The move is seen as a major boost for both states' economies. It is also seen as a major victory for proponents of legalized sports gambling.

"The NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL have all come out in support of legalized sports betting," said Purdum. "They see it as an opportunity to grow their businesses."

#  Connecticut and Indiana Poised to Offer Mobile Sports Betting

The two states are among the latest to announce they will offer mobile sports betting in the coming weeks.

Connecticut and Indiana are both on the verge of offering mobile sports betting, joining a growing number of states that have made such gambling available in recent months.

Connecticut officials say that mobile betting will be available “in the very near future”, with residents able to place wagers through the state’s existing online gaming site, PlaySugarHouse.com.

Indiana is expected to follow suit in the coming weeks, with Governor Eric Holcomb recently announcing that sports bets could be placed through the state’s horse racing tracks and off-track betting parlors.

Officials in both states expect that mobile sports betting will bring in significant revenue, with Connecticut expecting annual revenues of around $10 million and Indiana anticipating up to $50 million per year.

Other states that have recently launched mobile sports betting include New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Mississippi.

#  West Virginia the Latest State to Offer Mobile Sports Betting

West Virginia has become the latest state to legalize mobile sports betting. The new law, which was passed on March 9th, allows residents in the state to place bets on sporting events using their smartphones.

The passage of this bill is a major win for the gambling industry, as it opens up a new market for mobile sports betting operators. It is also likely to be a major boon for the local economy, as it is estimated that West Virginians will wager over $100 million annually on sports betting.

This new law comes just a few months after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting. That decision paved the way for states to legalize this form of gambling, and many have since taken steps to do so.

Mobile sports betting is quickly becoming one of the most popular forms of gambling in the US. In fact, a recent study found that over half of all Americans who gamble do so via their smartphone. This is largely due to the convenience and ease of use that mobile betting offers.

With more and more states legalizing mobile sports betting, it is likely that this form of gambling will continue to grow in popularity. This presents a major opportunity for operators in the space, as they look to tap into what is quickly becoming a booming market.

#  Rhode Island Could be Next State to Legalize Mobile Sports Betting

The Rhode Island Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) released a new report on Monday, September 10th, stating that mobile sports betting could be legalized in the state before the end of 2018. The report was compiled in response to Senate Bill 2514, which was introduced earlier this year and would legalize mobile sports betting in Rhode Island.

“Assuming a bill is enacted in 2018, we anticipate that sports betting would commence approximately six months thereafter,” said DGE Director Daniel McKee.

This is great news for Rhode Island residents, who have been clamoring for mobile sports betting since it was legalized in New Jersey in June of 2018. New Jersey has seen incredible success with their mobile sports betting app, DraftKings Sportsbook, and it looks like Rhode Island is set to follow suit.

Rhode Island is one of the few states where sports betting is currently legal, but only through land-based casinos. If SB 2514 is passed, residents will be able to place bets on their favorite teams through their smartphones or other mobile devices. This would be a huge win for the state, as it would generate much-needed revenue for the government while also providing a valuable entertainment option for residents.

The DGE report also stated that there is strong interest in mobile sports betting from both casino operators and consumers. In fact, there are currently 11 casino operators who have submitted proposals to offer mobile sports betting in Rhode Island if SB 2514 is passed. This shows that there is a lot of excitement surrounding this potential new industry, and lawmakers should move quickly to pass SB 2514 so that residents can start enjoying it.

It’s unclear at this point whether or not SB 2514 will pass, but it certainly looks like there is momentum behind it. With the state facing major budget problems, anything that can help generate new revenue is sure to be popular among lawmakers. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting development!
