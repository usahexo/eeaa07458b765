#  What is the Maryland Bacon Board?

The Maryland Bacon Board is a state-level board that promotes the production and consumption of bacon in the state of Maryland. It was founded in 2017 by four bacon enthusiasts, who were looking to create a organization that would promote all things bacon in the state.

The MABB has several objectives, which include increasing awareness of the benefits of bacon among Maryland residents, promoting the use of locally-grown pork and promoting Maryland-made bacon products. To help achieve these objectives, the MABB works with local farmers, businesses and restaurants to help support and promote bacon production and consumption in Maryland.

Since its inception, the MABB has made great progress in fulfilling its objectives. In just its first year, the MABB helped launch the Maryland Bacon Festival – an annual event that celebrates everything bacon. The festival features local food vendors, a “bacon cooking competition”, a kids zone and more.

The MABB has also partnered with several local businesses to promote Maryland-made bacon products. For example, one business – known as The Charmery – makes a variety of ice cream flavors using local bacon products. The MABB has helped promote The Charmery’s products by featuring them at various events and working with the business to create new flavors of ice cream specifically for the Maryland Bacon Festival.

The MABB is making great progress in fulfilling its objectives and helping to promote bacon production and consumption in Maryland. If you’re a fan of bacon, be sure to check out the website or Facebook page for more information on upcoming events and activities.
