#  Bacon is the new black

Bacon has long been a breakfast favorite, but in recent years it has also become a popular ingredient in savory dishes and snacks. Restaurants across the country have begun featuring bacon in appetizers, entrees, and desserts.

Bacon is not only tasty, but it is also nutritious. A 3-ounce serving of cooked bacon provides 38 grams of protein and only 2 grams of fat. This makes bacon a great choice for those who are looking for a high-protein, low-fat food.

Bacon can be used in a variety of dishes. For example, it can be added to quiche, omelets, salads, soup, potato salad, macaroni salad, and even ice cream. It can also be wrapped around other foods such as shrimp or asparagus.

If you are looking for some delicious and nutritious bacon recipes, here are a few ideas:

1. Bacon Wrapped Shrimp: Wrap raw bacon around fresh shrimp and bake at 400 degrees for 10-15 minutes or until the bacon is crispy.

2. Bacon Wrapped Asparagus: Wrap raw bacon around fresh asparagus spears and bake at 400 degrees for 10-15 minutes or until the bacon is crispy.

3. Broccoli Salad with Bacon: Toss chopped broccoli with crumbled cooked bacon, diced red onion, raisins, sunflower seeds, and Apple Cider Vinager dressing. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

#  Uh oh, looks like someone's bacon has gone cold

It's not often that you see a headline like that, but when you do it usually spells bad news for someone. In this particular case, the bacon has gone cold for the person who was meant to eat it.

This is just one of the many dangers of cooking bacon. It's always been a precarious process, with the potential to go wrong in so many ways. You could end up with undercooked bacon, burnt bacon, or bacon that's gone cold. And once it's cold, there's no going back.

Bacon is a delicious breakfast food, but it can also be a dangerous one. When cooked properly, it's a great way to start the day. But when it goes wrong, it can lead to disaster.

So next time you're cooking some bacon, take care to do it properly. Make sure the pan is hot enough and keep an eye on it so that it doesn't burn. And most importantly, make sure you eat it all before it goes cold!

#  Finally, a reason to be happy about waking up in the morning

There’s finally a good reason to be happy about waking up in the morning—the discovery of a new, natural antidepressant. Researchers from Lancaster University have discovered that extracts from the shrub Hypericum perforatum, also known as St John’s wort, can help to improve mood and reduce anxiety.

The team tested the effects of the extracts on rats and found that not only did they improve mood but that they also acted as an anti-inflammatory agent and improved cognitive function. The researchers believe that the active compounds in the extracts stimulate the production of serotonin and dopamine, two neurotransmitters that are associated with happiness and well-being.

This news is exciting for those who suffer from depression, as antidepressants can often have unpleasant side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction and drowsiness. The plant-based extracts offer a natural alternative with fewer side effects, and they could also be used to help boost mood in healthy people.

So if you’re feeling down in the dumps, consider giving St John’s wort a try—it just might be the boost you need to start smiling again.
