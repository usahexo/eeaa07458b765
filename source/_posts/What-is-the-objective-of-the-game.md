#  What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible in the allotted time. The first player or team to reach the target score, or the player with the most points after the timer runs out, wins the game.

# What are the basic rules?

In order to score points, players must flick their pieces into the opposing team's goal. The opponent can try to block the shot by trapping the piece against its goalpost. If a piece falls off of the playing field, that player loses a point.

The game is played on a square playing field that is divided into two halves by a black line. Players take turns flicking their pieces from their half of the field across to their opponent's side. A player can only flick their piece once per turn and must not touch it again until after their opponent has taken a turn.

If a player's piece touches the ground or if it is caught by an opponent, that player must forfeit their turn. In order to win, a player must flick their piece into their opponent's goal and keep it there for three seconds.

#  How do I play?

The basic way to play is to draw a card, then discard one and take another.

When you have seven cards, you must put down three cards on the table, one at a time. If any are the same suit, they form a set. If any are the same rank, they form a double. The other two cards become your new hand.

If you have no matches, you can either put down one card and take another from the deck or put down two cards and take no more.

If you put down one card and take another from the deck, the next player can either put down two cards (taking no more) or draw two and give one away. 
If they put down two cards and take no more, then the next player can either put down three cards (taking no more) or draw four and give two away.

#  What are the different symbols and what do they mean?

When it comes to trading, symbols are an important part of the process. They allow you to easily identify the various assets that you are interested in and make it possible to track their performance. In this article, we will take a look at the different symbols and what they mean.

The most common symbol is the dollar sign ($). This is used to represent US dollars and is often accompanied by a number which indicates how many units of that currency are being traded. For example, if you wanted to purchase 100 shares of Company ABC, you would need to enter $100 into your trading platform.

Another common symbol is the pound sterling (£). This is used to represent British pounds and typically has either a letter or number after it to indicate its value (e.g. £1 or £5). The euro (€) is another common currency and its symbol is similar to that of the pound sterling.

Some currencies also have unique symbols. The Japanese yen (¥) is represented by a reversed triangle and the Swiss franc (CHF) uses a plus (+) sign. finally, there are also some special commodity symbols which we will not go into detail about in this article.

So why are symbols important? They allow you to quickly and easily see how much an asset is worth without having to remember complex numbers. They also make it easy to compare the performance of different assets against each other. As a trader, it is essential that you understand the symbols and what they represent in order to make informed decisions about your investments.
