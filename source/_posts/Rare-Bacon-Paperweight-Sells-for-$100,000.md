#  Bacon Paperweight Could be Worth Half a Million Dollars

In today's market, anything related to bacon is sure to fetch a high price. So when a bacon paperweight surfaced at an auction in Boston, it was no surprise that it sold for a staggering $451,000. 

That's more than four times its estimated value of $100,000, making it one of the most expensive paperweights in history. 

The bacon paperweight is a 3-inch-tall and 2.5-inch-wide chunk of Lucite that has been filled with pieces of actual bacon. It was made in the early 1970s by Peter Alexander, who was known for his whimsical objets d'art. 

Alexander originally created the bacon paperweight as a joke, but it quickly became a hit with collectors. While there are other objets d'art made from bacon lurking out there, this is the only known example of a bacon paperweight.

#  24k Gold Eagle Found in Rare Bacon Paperweight

Smithtown, NY - A rare bacon paperweight that was found in a box of old papers has been sold at auction for $24,000.

The paperweight, which is made from 24-karat gold and wrapped in bacon, was discovered by the new owner while going through a box of papers that belonged to her late husband.

"I couldn't believe it when I saw it," said the new owner, who asked to remain anonymous. "I knew it was worth something, but I had no idea it would sell for so much money."

The paperweight was created by The Golden Pig, a company that specializes in making unique paperweights out of precious metals and bacon.

"We started making these paperweights about five years ago and they've become quite popular," said Gary Bacon, founder of The Golden Pig. "Most of them sell for around $100, but we've had a few go for as much as $1,000."

Bacon said he was surprised when he heard about the sale.

"I never thought one of our paperweights would sell for $24,000," he said. "But I'm not complaining. It's nice to know that our products are appreciated."
