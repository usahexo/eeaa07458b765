#  Sports Betting Will Be Huge In The US!

The Supreme Court recently struck down a law that prohibited sports betting across the US. This is great news for the gambling industry, as well as for the US economy as a whole.

Experts are predicting that sports betting will be a $7.1 billion market by 2020. That’s a lot of money! And it’s not just casinos that will benefit from this influx of cash; businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation companies will also reap the rewards.

There are already signs that the industry is heating up. In May alone, online sportsbook DraftKings saw an increase in bets of 150%. This is only going to continue as more and more people become interested in gambling on sports.

So why is sports betting such a big deal? For one thing, it’s incredibly exciting to watch games and then bet on them afterwards. There’s also something about winning money that makes it all the more enjoyable.

In addition, sports betting creates jobs and helps to support local businesses. It’s also great for tourism, as people will visit new places in order to place bets on their favorite teams.

Sports betting is sure to be a HUGE hit in the US! Get ready to make some serious profits!

#  How Big Will Sports Betting Be In The US?

There are a lot of questions surrounding the legality of sports betting in the US. But there is no question that it is a multi-billion dollar industry. How big will it be once it is finally legalized?

Some experts believe that it could be a $ 100 billion industry. That would represent a 10% increase in gambling revenue, and would make it one of the largest legal gambling markets in the world.

Others believe that it could be even bigger than that. The American Gaming Association believes that the market could be as large as $ 250 billion.

That would represent a 25% increase in gambling revenue, and would make sports betting one of the largest legal gambling markets in the world.

No one can say for sure how big the market will be. But there is no doubt that it is a lucrative industry that is begging to be legalized.

#  What's The Forecast For Sports Betting In The US?

The winds of change are blowing in the sports betting world, as more and more states legalize the activity. But what does the future hold for this burgeoning industry?

To start with, it's worth examining how we got to this point. In 1992, the US Supreme Court ruled that state-sponsored sports betting was not prohibited by the federal government. This created a legal grey area, which some states have since taken advantage of.

In recent years, there's been a push to fully legalize and regulate sports betting at a national level. This has been driven in part by the growing popularity of daily fantasy sports, which led to increased scrutiny of the industry.

In May 2018, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey, striking down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992. This effectively opened the door for other states to legalize sports betting.

As of July 2019, only nine states have legalized sports betting: Delaware, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and West Virginia. However, many others are expected to follow suit in the near future.

So what can we expect from the sports betting industry in the years ahead? There are a few key trends worth watching:

1. The market is projected to grow rapidly over the next few years. According to one study, the US sports betting market could be worth more than $8 billion by 2022. This growth will be fueled by increasing legalization efforts at both state and national levels.

2. Mobile betting is expected to be a key driver of growth in the industry. In 2017, mobile bets accounted for only 29% of all wagers placed on professional and collegiate sporting events. However, this figure is expected to jump to 50% by 2020. This is due in part to increasing smartphone penetration rates and advances in mobile technology.

3. Sportsbooks are likely to become increasingly competitive over the next few years. In order to attract new customers and differentiate themselves from their rivals, sportsbooks are likely to offer increasingly generous bonuses and rewards programs. They may also focus on developing innovative new products and services (such as virtual reality betting).

#  How Much Money Will Be Spent On Sports Betting In The US?

The gambling industry is a massive one, and it’s only getting bigger. In the United States, gambling is a $240 billion industry. Out of that, sports betting accounts for $4.7 billion. That’s a lot of money, but it’s still just a fraction of the overall gambling market.

Sports betting has been around for centuries, but it has only recently become legal in the US. Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting in 1949. Other states started to follow suit in the 1990s, but it was not until May 2018 that the Supreme Court ruled that sports betting was a constitutional right. This ruling allowed states to legalize sports betting if they wanted to.

Several states have taken advantage of this ruling and legalized sports betting. As of November 2018, there were 10 states with legal sports betting: Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana and Iowa. More states are expected to legalize sports betting in the near future.

Given how much money is already being spent on sports betting, it’s no surprise that the market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. A report from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming predicts that the US market for legal sports betting will grow from $4.7 billion in 2018 to $25 billion by 2023. That’s an impressive growth rate of over 330%.

There are several factors driving this growth. The first is the increasing legalization of sports betting across the country. The second is the growing popularity of gambling overall. Gambling has become more mainstream in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue.

The third factor driving growth is mobile gaming. More people are now using their smartphones to place bets than ever before. This trend is expected to continue as well, as more people get comfortable with using their phones to gamble.

All of these factors point towards significant growth for the US sports betting market in the coming years. If you’re looking to get into this market, now is definitely the time to do it!

The legalized betting market is growing rapidly in the United States. The industry is expected to be worth more than $11.4 billion by 2020, according to a study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a research and consulting firm focused on the gaming industry.

As sports fans gear up to bet on the Super Bowl, they will join the estimated 109 million Americans who wager on sports each year. That number is projected to grow as states legalize sports betting.

In October, New Jersey became the first state since the federal ban on sports betting was lifted in May to offer sports bets. It took just two weeks for Atlantic City's casinos to take in $16 million in bets, and that was just from mobile devices. Nevada, which has had legal sports betting for years, handled $5.3 billion in legal wagers in 2017. 

West Virginia will begin taking mobile sports bets this week, and Delaware plans to offer full-scale sports betting by the start of March Madness. Pennsylvania is expected to roll out regulations this month and begin accepting bets by summer. 

"The Super Bowl is the perfect stage to show how much bigger this is going to be," said Daniel Wallach, a gaming attorney with Becker & Poliakoff in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. "You're going to have hundreds of millions of dollars wagered on this game alone." 

The American Gaming Association (AGA), which represents casinos and gaming industries, estimates that Americans will wager $4.96 billion on Sunday's game between the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles - an increase of 20 percent from last year's total of $4.1 billion. About 97 percent of that will be bet illegally, according to the AGA.

"Illegal gambling has been part of our culture for generations," said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the AGA. "Sports betting is simply another form of legal entertainment – one that tens of millions of Americans will engage in this weekend." 

Freeman said that making sports betting legal will protect consumers and provide new revenue for states and tribes interested in expanding gambling options. He noted that it would also create jobs – an estimated 150,000 Americans are currently employed in gambling-related positions. 

Wallach agreed that legalization would be good for the industry but said there are some concerns about how it will be implemented. "It's not clear yet how well these new laws are going to be written," he said. "There are a lot of moving parts."
