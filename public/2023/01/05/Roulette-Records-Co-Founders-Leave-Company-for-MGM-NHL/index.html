            <h1 id="Roulette-Records-Co-Founders-Leave-Company-for-MGM-NHL"><a href="#Roulette-Records-Co-Founders-Leave-Company-for-MGM-NHL" class="headerlink" title="Roulette Records Co-Founders Leave Company for MGM NHL"></a>Roulette Records Co-Founders Leave Company for MGM NHL</h1><p>Roulette Records co-founders, Jean-Philippe and Daniel Lemay, are leaving the company to join MGM as NHL executives. The news comes as a surprise to the industry as the duo had been with Roulette since its inception in 2006.</p>
<p>Commenting on their departure, Jean-Philippe Lemay said, “After over a decade of dedicating our lives to Roulette Records we felt it was time for a new challenge. We’re excited to join MGM as NHL executives and help grow the sport in North America.”</p>
<p>Roulette Records has been a leading independent record label specializing in electronic music. Under the Lemay brothers’ stewardship, the label released groundbreaking albums from artists such as Daft Punk, David Guetta, and Martin Solveig.</p>
<p>In a statement, Roulette Records CEO Max Wheeler said, “We’re sad to see Jean-Philippe and Daniel leave but we wish them all the best in their new role at MGM. They’ve been an instrumental part of Roulette’s success and we’re confident that they’ll continue to make a significant impact on the music industry.”</p>

The small, but mighty graphic design studio has created thousands of album covers for a variety of independent and major music labels over the last two decades.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Roulette Records made the switch to using MGM NHLs in their design process. The results have been stunning.</p>
<p>“Our clients are always happy with the quality and vibrancy of our work,” said studio owner David Martinez. “The MGM NHLs give us the precision and range of color we need to create truly amazing designs.”</p>
<p>What’s more, Roulette Records has seen a significant increase in business since making the switch to MGM NHL printing technology. Record labels from all over the world now come to them for album art design services.</p>
<p>Martinez believes that the success of his studio is due largely to MGM NHL printers.</p>
<p>“They offer an unbeatable value and quality that we just can’t find anywhere else,” he said.</p>

<p>“We are so proud of our designers,” said Roulette Records founder and CEO, Damien Randall. “They have worked hard to make a name for themselves in the industry and this is a great opportunity for them.”</p>
<p>The two designers, who are remaining anonymous until the official launch of the team next month, will be responsible for all visual branding and marketing collateral for the new MGM NHL team.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to working with the MGM NHL team and helping them create a successful brand that resonates with their fans,” said one of the designers in a statement.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Roulette Records has partnered with a professional sports team. In 2016 they teamed up with the LA Rams to create all of their branding and marketing materials.</p>
<h1 id="Roulette-Records-Designers-End-Deal-with-MGM-NHL-Start-Their-Own-Firm"><a href="#Roulette-Records-Designers-End-Deal-with-MGM-NHL-Start-Their-Own-Firm" class="headerlink" title="Roulette Records Designers End Deal with MGM NHL, Start Their Own Firm"></a>Roulette Records Designers End Deal with MGM NHL, Start Their Own Firm</h1><p>In a stunning coup, roulette records designers have decided to break their contract with MGM National Hockey League, and have announced the formation of their own firm.</p>
<p>The new company, to be called Roulette Records Designers LLP, will provide design and marketing services to a wide range of clients in the music and entertainment industries. The move is seen as a major coup by industry observers, who note that the team at Roulette Records Designers has a proven track record in creating high-quality, award-winning designs.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting new chapter for us,” said Roulette Records Designers partner Allen Hsu. “We’re looking forward to bringing our unique brand of creativity and innovation to a wider range of clients.”</p>

<p>Roulette Records Designers is confident that it can continue its success under its new banner. “We have a talented team of designers that are motivated to succeed and deliver top-quality results for our clients,” said Hsu.</p>
