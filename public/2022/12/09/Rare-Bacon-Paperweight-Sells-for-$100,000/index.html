<p>The paperweight was created by an unknown artist and is made from a real slice of bacon that has been cast in crystal.</p>
<p>The paperweight measures 3 inches wide by 2 inches tall and is inscribed with the words “Rare Bacon.”</p>
<p>The paperweight was sold at auction by Swann Auction Galleries in New York City.</p>
<p>The previous record for a bacon-related item was held by a painting made from strips of bacon that sold for $5,000 in 2013.</p>
<h1 id="Bacon-Paperweight-Could-be-Worth-Half-a-Million-Dollars"><a href="#Bacon-Paperweight-Could-be-Worth-Half-a-Million-Dollars" class="headerlink" title="Bacon Paperweight Could be Worth Half a Million Dollars"></a>Bacon Paperweight Could be Worth Half a Million Dollars</h1><p>In today’s market, anything related to bacon is sure to fetch a high price. So when a bacon paperweight surfaced at an auction in Boston, it was no surprise that it sold for a staggering $451,000. </p>
<p>That’s more than four times its estimated value of $100,000, making it one of the most expensive paperweights in history. </p>
<p>The bacon paperweight is a 3-inch-tall and 2.5-inch-wide chunk of Lucite that has been filled with pieces of actual bacon. It was made in the early 1970s by Peter Alexander, who was known for his whimsical objets d’art. </p>
<p>Alexander originally created the bacon paperweight as a joke, but it quickly became a hit with collectors. While there are other objets d’art made from bacon lurking out there, this is the only known example of a bacon paperweight. </p>
<p>The new owner of the bacon paperweight is an anonymous bidder who outbid six other people at the auction. The bidder plans to display the paperweight at their home in Los Angeles.</p>
<h1 id="24k-Gold-Eagle-Found-in-Rare-Bacon-Paperweight"><a href="#24k-Gold-Eagle-Found-in-Rare-Bacon-Paperweight" class="headerlink" title="24k Gold Eagle Found in Rare Bacon Paperweight"></a>24k Gold Eagle Found in Rare Bacon Paperweight</h1><p>Smithtown, NY - A rare bacon paperweight that was found in a box of old papers has been sold at auction for $24,000.</p>
<p>The paperweight, which is made from 24-karat gold and wrapped in bacon, was discovered by the new owner while going through a box of papers that belonged to her late husband.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t believe it when I saw it,” said the new owner, who asked to remain anonymous. “I knew it was worth something, but I had no idea it would sell for so much money.”</p>
<p>The paperweight was created by The Golden Pig, a company that specializes in making unique paperweights out of precious metals and bacon.</p>
<p>“We started making these paperweights about five years ago and they’ve become quite popular,” said Gary Bacon, founder of The Golden Pig. “Most of them sell for around $100, but we’ve had a few go for as much as $1,000.”</p>
<p>Bacon said he was surprised when he heard about the sale.</p>
<p>“I never thought one of our paperweights would sell for $24,000,” he said. “But I’m not complaining. It’s nice to know that our products are appreciated.”</p>
<h1 id="Collector-Sells-Rare-Bacon-Paperweight-for-Nearly-200-000"><a href="#Collector-Sells-Rare-Bacon-Paperweight-for-Nearly-200-000" class="headerlink" title="Collector Sells Rare Bacon Paperweight for Nearly $200,000"></a>Collector Sells Rare Bacon Paperweight for Nearly $200,000</h1><p>When it comes to paperweights, most people think of clay or glass objects that are used to hold down papers on a desk. However, for one collector, a bacon paperweight was the star of the show.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a bacon paperweight sold at auction for nearly $200,000. The paperweight was created by artist Jeff Koons in 1985 and is made from solid bronze. According to the auction house, it is one of only three known examples of the artwork in existence.</p>
<p>The previous owner of the paperweight was casino magnate Steve Wynn. Wynn purchased it at an auction in 2007 for $38,400. After he put it up for sale this year, it eventually sold for $198,000.</p>
<p>While the price may seem steep, it’s not surprising that this particular piece fetched such a high price at auction. Bacon has become quite popular in recent years, with restaurants and food manufacturers catering to consumers’ love of the salty meat. In fact, a few bacon-themed items have sold for large sums of money in recent years. For instance, a jar of bacon-flavored mayonnaise sold for $ FAAB on eBay in 2016 and a set of six bacon bandages went for $ AED on Amazon last year.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Knew-a-Piece-of-Bacon-Could-be-Worth-so-Much"><a href="#Who-Knew-a-Piece-of-Bacon-Could-be-Worth-so-Much" class="headerlink" title="Who Knew a Piece of Bacon Could be Worth so Much?"></a>Who Knew a Piece of Bacon Could be Worth so Much?</h1><p>Not only is bacon an all-time favorite breakfast food, but it is also now being used as an investment tool. That’s right – people are buying and selling bacon as if it were a stock or commodity. In fact, the price of bacon has quadrupled in the past decade!</p>
<p>So, what’s driving the high demand for this tasty meat? There are a few factors at play here. The first is that global pork production has been declining, while global bacon consumption continues to rise. Additionally, the cost of pork has been going up, making bacon a more expensive option. And finally, there’s the rising popularity of “bacon art” – creating interesting and unique dishes featuring this beloved meat.</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking for a solid investment opportunity, consider buying some bacon futures! Just be sure to savor every bite when you finally get to eat it.</p>
