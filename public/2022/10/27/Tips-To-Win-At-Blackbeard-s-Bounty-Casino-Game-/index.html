<h1 id="Blackbeard-s-Bounty-Strategy-How-To-Win-More-Often"><a href="#Blackbeard-s-Bounty-Strategy-How-To-Win-More-Often" class="headerlink" title="Blackbeard s Bounty Strategy: How To Win More Often"></a>Blackbeard s Bounty Strategy: How To Win More Often</h1><p>There are many blackjack strategies that can be used in order to win more often when playing the game. One such strategy is called Blackbeard’s Bounty. Named after the most infamous pirate of all time, Blackbeard’s Bounty is a six step strategy that can help players increase their chances of winning at blackjack.</p>
<p>The first step in the Blackbeard’s Bounty strategy is to always stand on 17 or higher. This will help reduce the risk of losing your bet when the dealer has a high card. The next step is to split pairs of eights and aces whenever possible. Splitting these pairs will give you two chances to win rather than just one, increasing your odds of winning overall.</p>
<p>The third step in Blackbeard’s Bounty is to never take insurance. Many players make the mistake of taking insurance when they have blackjack, but this actually decreases your odds of winning by 50%. The fourth step is to double down on any hand totaling 9, 10, or 11. This will give you a better chance of winning more money with each bet.</p>
<p>The fifth step in Blackbeard’s Bounty is to always take a hit when your hand totals 6 or lower. This will give you the best chance of getting closer to 21 without going over and losing your bet. The sixth and final step in this strategy is to surrender if your hand totals 15 or 16. Surrendering allows you to lose less money on hands that are likely to lose anyway, so it’s a good option to consider if you want to minimize your losses.</p>
<p>Following these six steps will help you improve your chances of winning at blackjack and increase your overall payout rate. If you want to start seeing bigger profits from your blackjack games, be sure to try out the Blackbeard’s Bounty strategy today!</p>
