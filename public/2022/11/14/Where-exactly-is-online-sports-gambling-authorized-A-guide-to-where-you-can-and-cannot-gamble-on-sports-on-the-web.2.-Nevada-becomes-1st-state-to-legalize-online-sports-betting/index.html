<h1 id="3-Delaware-legalizes-online-sports-betting"><a href="#3-Delaware-legalizes-online-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="3. Delaware legalizes online sports betting"></a>3. Delaware legalizes online sports betting</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>On June 5, 2018, the Delaware state legislature passed a bill to legalize online sports betting. The bill allows licensed casinos in Delaware to offer online sports betting services to residents and visitors in the state.</p>
<p>The bill was proposed by Democratic Rep. Helene Keeley and Republican Sen. Brian Bushweller. It passed the House by a vote of 27-5 and the Senate by a vote of 17-2.</p>
<p>Governor John Carney is expected to sign the bill into law. Once signed, Delaware will become the first state to offer legal online sports betting since the Supreme Court struck down PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) in May 2018.</p>
<p>PASPA was a 1992 federal law that prohibited states from authorizing or licensing sports betting operations. In May 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that PASPA was unconstitutional because it violated the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution.</p>
<p>The Tenth Amendment states that “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” In other words, the Tenth Amendment reserves powers not specifically granted to the federal government to be exercised by individual states or citizens.</p>
<p>This ruling opened up the possibility for states to legalize online sports betting within their borders. Many states are now exploring this possibility, and several have introduced legislation to legalize online sports betting.</p>
<p>Delaware is well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity because it already has a well-regulated casino industry. The state has three licensed casinos: Dover Downs Hotel and Casino, Harrington Raceway and Casino, and Delaware Park Racetrack and Casino. These casinos already offer gambling services such as casino games, poker, and horseracing.</p>
<p>Under the new bill, these casinos will be able to offer online sports betting services as well. Customers will be able to place bets on sporting events through an online platform or mobile app. The legislation requires that customers be at least 21 years old and located in Delaware at the time of placing a bet.</p>
<p>The bill also imposes a number of regulations on online sports betting operations. These include requirements that casinos maintain accurate records of customer bets, prohibit employees from placing bets on games they are involved in, and prohibit minors from accessing gambling websites or apps.</p>
<h1 id="4-New-Jersey-strikes-down-federal-ban-on-online-sports-betting"><a href="#4-New-Jersey-strikes-down-federal-ban-on-online-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="4. New Jersey strikes down federal ban on online sports betting"></a>4. New Jersey strikes down federal ban on online sports betting</h1><p>The US Supreme Court struck down a law banning states from legalizing sports betting on Monday, in a ruling that could unleash a nationwide race to offer the lucrative activity.</p>
<p>Gamblers in Nevada have been able to bet legally on sports for years, but the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992 prohibited most other states from following suit.</p>
<p>New Jersey lawmakers argued that the ban amounted to unconstitutional discrimination against their state, and in a 6-3 ruling the high court agreed.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” wrote Justice Samuel Alito in the majority opinion. “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each State is free to act on its own.”</p>
<p>New Jersey plans to start taking bets within weeks, and analysts say up to 32 states could soon follow suit. That could create a multibillion-dollar industry, with slot machines at race tracks and casinos offering sports betting alongside traditional casino games like blackjack and roulette.</p>
<h1 id="5-West-Virginia-becomes-latest-state-to-legalize-online-sports-gambling"><a href="#5-West-Virginia-becomes-latest-state-to-legalize-online-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="5. West Virginia becomes latest state to legalize online sports gambling"></a>5. West Virginia becomes latest state to legalize online sports gambling</h1><p>Online sports gambling is now legal in the state of West Virginia. Governor Jim Justice made the announcement on Thursday, October 11, making West Virginia the fifth state in the nation to legalize the activity.</p>
<p>Justice said that he expects the new law to create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state. Under the new law, residents will be able to bet on sporting events through licensed online sportsbooks.</p>
<p>The move comes as a bit of a surprise, as Justice had previously voiced his opposition to legalized sports betting. However, he seems to have had a change of heart since becoming governor earlier this year.</p>
<p>West Virginia is following in the footsteps of four other states that have already legalized online sports gambling: Delaware, New Jersey, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. All four of those states have seen significant revenue growth from online sports betting.</p>
<p>According to Morgan Fox, spokesperson for the Washington D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, other states are likely to follow suit. “As more and more states see how much money can be raised through regulated sports betting, it’s only a matter of time before everyone either authorizes it or tolerates it,” said Fox.</p>
