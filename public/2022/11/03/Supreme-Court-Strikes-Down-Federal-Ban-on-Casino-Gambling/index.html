            <h1 id="Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Ban-on-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Ban-on-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban on Casino Gambling"></a>Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban on Casino Gambling</h1><p>The US Supreme Court on Monday struck down a 1992 federal law that banned most forms of casino gambling across the country. The 6-3 ruling is a victory for New Jersey, which has been trying to legalize casinos in Atlantic City for years.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion, holding that the ban violated the Tenth Amendment by commandeering states to maintain a prohibition on casino gambling. “The anti-commandeering principle protects every state against being forced to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program,” Alito wrote.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. “Congress has broad power to regulate what activities take place within borders, and its regulation of this activity is reasonable,” Breyer wrote.</p>
<p>The decision overturns a 2011 ruling by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which had upheld the ban. It was one of several high-profile cases heard by the Supreme Court this term, including challenges to President Obama’s healthcare law and to gay marriage bans in Michigan and Kentucky.</p>
<h1 id="Court-Upholds-Right-to-Casino-Gambling-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Court-Upholds-Right-to-Casino-Gambling-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Court Upholds Right to Casino Gambling in New Jersey"></a>Court Upholds Right to Casino Gambling in New Jersey</h1><p>On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld New Jersey’s right to offer casino gambling, striking down a federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing the practice.</p>
<p>The decision was a victory for Gov. Chris Christie, who has pushed for legalized casino gambling in New Jersey as a way to revive the state’s flagging economy. It was also a major defeat for the casino industry, which had fought to keep the prohibition in place.</p>
<p>Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that the federal law violated the principle of state sovereignty laid out in the 10th Amendment to the Constitution.</p>
<p>“The framers gave to Congress a power that is both broad and flexible,” he wrote. “Under our Constitution, Congress may regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, but it may not directly regulate purely intrastate activitiesabsent a demonstrated relationship to interstate commerce.”</p>
<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy joined with the majority but wrote separately to say that he would have gone further and struck down the entire federal law.</p>
<p>The decision allows New Jersey to move ahead with its plans to expand casino gambling at two racetracks, in addition to the 12 casinos already operating in the state. It is also likely to embolden other states that are considering similar proposals, including Illinois, Texas and California.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Gambling-Now-Legal-in-Several-States"><a href="#Casino-Gambling-Now-Legal-in-Several-States" class="headerlink" title="Casino Gambling Now Legal in Several States"></a>Casino Gambling Now Legal in Several States</h1><p>Casino gambling is now legal in several states. This has led to a great increase in revenue for these states, as well as more jobs.</p>
<p>The first state to legalize casino gambling was Delaware. This was in 2012. Since then, four other states have followed suit: Nevada, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Illinois. Each of these states has seen a boost in revenue and employment thanks to casino gambling.</p>
<p>In Nevada, for example, casino gambling accounted for $960 million in tax revenue in 2015. That’s an increase of nearly 25% from the year before. In New Jersey, casino gambling brought in $1.48 billion in tax revenue in 2016 – an increase of more than 36% from the year before.</p>
<p>These numbers are clear evidence that casino gambling is a major boon to state economies. It creates jobs and brings in much-needed revenue. States would be wise to legalize it everywhere!</p>
<h1 id="Court-Rules-Against-Ban-on-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Court-Rules-Against-Ban-on-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Court Rules Against Ban on Casino Gambling"></a>Court Rules Against Ban on Casino Gambling</h1><p>The US Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that the ban on casino gambling in the state of New Jersey was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>In a 3-0 decision, the court determined that the federal law banning most forms of gambling across the country preempted New Jersey’s state law, which allowed casino gambling only in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The three-judge panel said that while Congress has broad power to regulate interstate commerce, it cannot allow some states to opt out of federal laws that others must follow.</p>
<p>“If Congress may legislate with respect to activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, then certainly it may do so with respect to gambling,” Judge Thomas Ambro wrote for the panel. “New Jersey’s enactment of casino gambling in 1976 falls squarely within Congress’ authority.”</p>
<p>The decision is a victory for Gov. Chris Christie, who had made legalizing casino gambling a top priority and argued that it would help revive Atlantic City’s struggling economy. The gaming industry has also been lobbying for the legalization of casino gambling nationwide.</p>
<p>But it is a defeat for Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate who bankrolled efforts to block any expansion of legalized gambling. Adelson has argued that casinos lead to addiction and social ills.</p>
<h1 id="More-States-Moving-Towards-Legalizing-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#More-States-Moving-Towards-Legalizing-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="More States Moving Towards Legalizing Casino Gambling"></a>More States Moving Towards Legalizing Casino Gambling</h1><p>It seems that more and more states are in the process of legalizing casino gambling in one form or another. This is good news for the casino industry, as well as for the states that are making the move.</p>
<p>One recent development on this front was in Pennsylvania. There, lawmakers finally reached an agreement on a bill that would legalize casino gambling in the state. The bill now goes to the governor for his signature.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has been without legalized casino gambling since 2004, when lawmakers banned it. The hope is that this new bill will bring in much-needed revenue to help shore up the state’s budget deficit.</p>
<p>Other states that have been moving towards legalizing casino gambling include Arkansas, Iowa, and Michigan. In Arkansas, lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow casinos in four specific counties. In Iowa, there is a proposal to legalize casino gambling at racetracks. And in Michigan, a ballot initiative is being proposed that would allow casinos in three cities: Detroit, Pontiac, and Windsor (which is in Canada).</p>
<p>If all of these proposals are successful, it will mean big changes for the casino industry. It will also mean more competition for states like Nevada and New Jersey, which have long been considered leaders in this sector.</p>
